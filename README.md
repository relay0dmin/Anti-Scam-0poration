# Anti-Scam-0poration

Anti-Scam Project — README



SUMMARY:
The Anti-Scam Project is a compact, onion-only research initiative focused on telecom fraud. We collect vetted reports, analyze infrastructure and tactics, and build defensive tooling and disruption playbooks. We recruit skilled, security-minded contributors for analysis, tooling, intel, and secure operations.


Note: All role descriptions and onboarding details are provided only after an initial contact with relay0dmin via our Tor link. The Tor contact link appears in the Contact section below.




MISSION:
Identify scam infrastructure and tactics used in telecom fraud.

Collect high-quality, verifiable reports and artifacts.

Build tools and procedures that help victims, defenders, and law enforcement reduce harm.

Share defensive research and safe tooling while enforcing strict OPSEC.




SCOPE (WHAT WE DO):
Passive collection and analysis of scam indicators (phone numbers, infrastructure, call patterns).

Archive and classify evidence: audio clips, metadata, callflows, screenshots, and public infrastructure artifacts.

Develop detection tooling and automated indicators to help defenders prioritize and respond.

Produce clear, non-destructive disruption playbooks: reporting channels, registrar and hoster engagement, and abuse workflows.

Coordinate, when lawful and appropriate, with CERTs, hosters, and law enforcement on validated leads.




OUT OF SCOPE (WHAT WE DO NOT DO):
Offensive cyber operations. No unauthorized access to third-party systems.

No scanning, disruption, takedowns, or exploitation of systems without explicit written permission or legal authority.

We do not publish raw PII or unredacted victim data.

No doxxing, harassment, or vigilantism.




TEAM ROLES AND EXPECTATIONS:

Role details and exact responsibilities are provided after initial contact with relay0dmin over Tor. We look for contributors who bring measurable technical skills and who operate to high OPSEC standards.

Typical roles we recruit for include:

Network/VoIP Analyst — SIP/SS7/ENUM analysis and metadata correlation.

Signal/Audio Analyst — voicemail and call audio triage, transcription, and artifact analysis.

Infrastructure Researcher — passive footprinting of domains, hosts, and registrars.

Backend Engineer — secure ingestion pipelines, parsers, and indicator stores.

Frontend/UX — minimal, secure dashboards for vetted partners.

OpSec & Infra — hardened hosting, onion services, key management, and logging policy.

Legal/Policy Liaison — legal review, disclosure coordination, and safe escalation.





VETTING AND ONBOARDING (HIGH LEVEL):

Initial contact via Tor. Provide an encrypted technical CV and a short proof-of-skill artifact. Do not include identifying metadata.

Automated authenticity checks and a short technical task or interview.

Limited access granted on a need-to-know basis. Elevated privileges after probation and OPSEC verification.





DATA HANDLING AND OPSEC:

Redact PII by default. Only authorized analysts may access raw material and only for validated, necessary analysis.

Store secrets and private keys encrypted at rest. Minimum file perms 600 for private keys.

Keep logs minimal. Rotate and expire logs regularly.

Use compartmentalized environments. Separate work VMs from personal devices.

Use PGP for encrypted submissions. Rotate keys per role when required.

Never publish raw evidence or PII without legal review and redaction.





OPERATIONAL PLAYBOOK (SUMMARY):

Triage and classify incoming reports.

Passively enrich indicators with OSINT and metadata.

Verify findings without interacting with suspect infrastructure.

Produce defensive artifacts: blocklists, abuse reports, and partner briefings.

Coordinate lawful disclosure with hosters, CERTs, or law enforcement when appropriate.

Publish sanitized, cleared reports to partners or the public after legal review.




LEGAL BOUNDARIES:

We operate only within applicable law. Any active measure that could constitute unauthorized access or damage requires explicit legal sign-off.

If you are unsure whether a planned action is lawful, consult the legal liaison before proceeding.


 

CONTACT:

Tor-only contact (onion): contact relay0dmin via our Tor link. The Tor contact link will be placed here in the README once published.
Encrypted submissions and initial vetting are mandatory. Do not send identifying metadata.



HOW TO APPLY (BREIF):

Obtain our PGP public key via the Tor contact after initial handshake.

Prepare a short technical CV and one proof-of-skill artifact (tool, writeup, or repo). Encrypt both with our project key.

Send the encrypted package via Tor to relay0dmin. Expect vetting instructions in reply.



FINAL NOTES:

We prioritize measurable defensive impact over publicity. Join only if you can operate under strict OPSEC and legal constraints. Contributors must follow project rules and sign a contributor agreement before receiving elevated access.
