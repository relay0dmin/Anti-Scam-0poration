# Contributing

Thanks for your interest. This document covers public, non-sensitive contributions.

## Before you start
- Read `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and the public README.  
- Public contributions should not contain PII, unredacted evidence, or operational OPSEC details.

## How to contribute
- For docs, tests, or tooling: fork → branch → PR with tests and description.  
- For sensitive contributions (artifacts, leads): follow private onboarding procedures — do not upload sensitive materials to this public repo.

## Coding standards
- Keep code well-documented and include unit tests.  
- Provide a short architectural note for non-trivial changes.

## Review & access
- Maintainers will review PRs; security-sensitive changes may require additional verification.
